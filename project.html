   <p class="projecttext">What is "Occupy Space"? <br>This is a student project by <a href="http://ginabartzok.de/" target="_blank" style="color: black">Gina Bartzok</a>, which was developed during a course at Hochschule Mainz by Prof. Florian Jennett. This Project focuses on the different languages people use to describe dance. The videos used on this page don't belong to me, but to <a href="https://www.nowness.com/" target="_blank" style="color: black">Nowness</a>. <b> <br> Why is this page called "Occupy space"? <br> Well, this project didn't had a name for a long time. But then someone, i don't know who, described one video with these words. When I read it I really liked this description, because to me this matches a lot of motions pretty good.</p>
